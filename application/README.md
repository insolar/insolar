Insolar â€“ Application Layer
==================================================
Proof-Of-Concept, platform for realizations of dApps.

Overview
--------
Application module describes interaction of system components with each other.

Every component of the system is a `SmartContract`. Members of the system are given the opportunity to build their own dApps by publishing smart contracts in `Domain` instances.

Domains define the visibility scope for the child contracts and their interaction policies. Actually, `Domain` is subclass of `SmartContract`.
