// Handle is a one-function synchronous process that can call routines to do long processing.

// Procedure is a task that can execute itself.
// Please note that the Procedure is marked as canceled if a pulse happens during it's execution. This means that it
// continues to execute in the background, though it's return value will be discarded.
// Thus if you have multiple steps that can be executed in different pulses split them into separate Procedures.
// Otherwise join the steps into a single Procedure.
// It's a good idea to keep Procedures in a separate package to hide internal state from Handle.

	// If Routine returns first, Procedure error (if any) will be returned.

	// the execution by reading from context.Done()

	// Migrate blocks caller execution until cancellation happens then runs provided Handle in a new flow.
	// Note that this method can be called after cancellation. Use it to migrate processing after Handle or Procedure
	// returned ErrCancelled.

	// IMPORTANT: Migrate can be called only once per flow. Calling it the second time will result in error.

	// It might be called multiple times, but each time it will wait for cancellation.
