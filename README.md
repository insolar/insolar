# Insolar Platform 1.0

Insolar Platform 1.0 resides in this repository. Insolar MainNet application (and its benchmark) resides in the [insolar/mainnet repository](https://github.com/insolar/mainnet) and runs on top of Platform 1.0.

Assured Ledger, Insolar's Platform-as-a-Service solution, is being actively developed in the [insolar/assured-ledger repository](https://github.com/insolar/assured-ledger).

## Quick start

To learn what distinguishes Insolar from other blockchain projects, go through the [list of our features](https://insolar.io/platform?utm_source=Github). 

To get a grip on how Insolar works, take a look at the [big picture](https://docs.insolar.io/en/latest/basics.html) and explore the [architecture](https://docs.insolar.io/en/latest/architecture.html).

To run the Insolar Platform 1.0 locally, install it and deploy as described below.

### Install

1. Install the latest 1.15 version of the [Golang programming tools](https://golang.org/doc/install#install). Make sure the `$GOPATH` environment variable is set.

2. Download the Insolar package:

   ```
   go get github.com/insolar/insolar
   ```

3. Go to the package directory:

   ```
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/insolar/insolar
   ```

4. Install dependencies and build binaries:

   ```
   make
   ```

### Deploy locally

To deploy the Insolar network locally, run the launcher:

```
insolar-scripts/insolard/launchnet.sh -g
```

The launcher generates bootstrap data, starts a pulse watcher, and launches a number of nodes. In local setup, the "nodes" are simply services listening on different ports.
The default number of nodes is 5, you can uncomment more in `scripts/insolard/bootstrap_template.yaml`.

When the pulse watcher says `INSOLAR STATE: READY`, the network is up and running.
