# Quick start

To learn what distinguishes Insolar from other blockchain projects, go through the [list of our features](https://insolar.io/platform?utm_source=Github). 

To get a grip on how Insolar works, take a look at its [architecture overview](https://docs.insolar.io/en/latest/architecture.html#architecture).

To join the Insolar network, download the [latest release](https://github.com/insolar/insolar/releases) and follow the [integration instructions](https://docs.insolar.io/en/latest/integration.html).

To test Insolar locally, install it and deploy as described below.

## Install

1. Install the latest 1.12 version of the [Golang programming tools](https://golang.org/doc/install#install). Make sure the `$GOPATH` environment variable is set.

2. Download the Insolar package:

   ```
   go get github.com/insolar/insolar
   ```

3. Go to the package directory:

   ```
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/insolar/insolar
   ```

4. Install dependencies and build binaries:

    ```
    make
    ```

## Deploy locally

1. Run the launcher:

   ```
   scripts/insolard/launchnet.sh -g
   ```

   It generates bootstrap data, starts a pulse watcher, and launches a number of nodes. In local setup, the "nodes" are simply services listening on different ports.
   The default number of nodes is 5, you can uncomment more in `scripts/insolard/bootstrap_template.yaml`.

2. When the pulse watcher says `INSOLAR STATE: READY`, you can run the following:

   * Requester:

     ```
     bin/apirequester -k=.artifacts/launchnet/configs/ -u=http://127.0.0.1:19101/api
     ```

     The requester runs a scenario: creates a number of users with wallets and transfers some money between them. For the first time, the script does it sequentially, upon subsequent runs — concurrently.

     Options:
     * `-k`: Path to the root user's key pair. All requests for a new user creation must be signed by the root one.
     * `-u`: Node's API URL. By default, the first node listens on the `127.0.0.1:19101` port. It can be changed in configuration.

   * Benchmark:

     ```
     bin/benchmark -c=4 -r=25 -k=.artifacts/launchnet/configs/
     ```

     Options:
     * `-k`: Path to the root user's key pair.
     * `-c`: Number of concurrent threads in which requests are sent.
     * `-r`: Number of transfer requests to be sent in each thread.
