Package host is a fundamental part of networking system. Each host has:

 - one real network address (IP or any other transport protocol address)
 - multiple abstract network IDs (either host's own or ones belonging to relayed hosts)

Contains structures to describe network entities in code.

Usage:

 	originAddress, err := host.NewAddress(address)
	if err != nil {
		...
	}

	origin, err := host.NewOrigin(nil, originAddress)
	if err != nil {
		...
	}
