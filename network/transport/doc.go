/*
Package transport provides network transport interface. It allows to abstract our network from physical transport.
It can either be IP based network or any other kind of packet courier (e.g. an industrial packet bus).

Package exports simple interfaces for easily defining new transports.

For now we provide two implementations of transport.
The default is UTPTransport which using BitTorrent ÂµTP protocol.

Usage:

	var conn net.PacketConn
	// get udp connection anywhere

	tp, _ := transport.NewUTPTransport(conn)
	msg := &packet.Packet{}

	// Send the async queries and wait for a future
	future, err := tp.SendRequest(msg)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	select {
	case response := <-future.Result():
		// Channel was closed
		if response == nil {
			panic("chanel closed unexpectedly")
		}

		// do something with response

	case <-time.After(1 * time.Second):
		future.Cancel()
	}
