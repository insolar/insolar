Package packet provides network messaging protocol and serialization layer.

Packet can be created with shortcut:

	senderAddr, _ := host.NewAddress("127.0.0.1:1337")
	receiverAddr, _ := host.NewAddress("127.0.0.1:1338")

	sender := host.NewHost(senderAddr)
	receiver := host.NewHost(receiverAddr)

	msg := packet.NewPingPacket(sender, receiver)

	// do something with packet


Or with builder:

	builder := packet.NewBuilder()

	senderAddr, _ := host.NewAddress("127.0.0.1:1337")
	receiverAddr, _ := host.NewAddress("127.0.0.1:1338")

	sender := host.NewHost(senderAddr)
	receiver := host.NewHost(receiverAddr)

	msg := builder.
		Sender(sender).
		Receiver(receiver).
		Type(packet.TypeFindHost).
		Request(&packet.RequestDataFindHost{}).
		Build()

	// do something with packet


Packet may be serialized:

	msg := &packet.Packet{}
	serialized, err := packet.SerializePacket(msg)

	if err != nil {
		panic(err.Error())
	}

	fmt.Println(serialized)


And deserialized therefore:

	var buffer bytes.Buffer

	// Fill buffer somewhere

	msg, err := packet.DeserializePacket(buffer)

	if err != nil {
		panic(err.Error())
	}

	// do something with packet
